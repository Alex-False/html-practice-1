    <h1>Cities I've lived in</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Iowa City<span>  "This city is on my list because it is my birth city."</span></li>
      <p>I was born in Iowa city and lived there for the first 8 months of my life. My father found a job oppertunity in Indiana and we moved.</p>
      <li>New Albany<span>  "This city is on my list because it is the place I sent my early childhood. Many fond memories of the Gamecube."</span></li>
      <p>The before mentioned job oppertunity was in Lousiville, KY but New Albany had better housing options and was only a 30 minute commute. I lived here until I was 7 years old.</p>
      <li>Jeffersonville<span>  "This city is on my list because it is where I spent most of my life and graduated highschool from."</span></li>
      <P>My family was renting in New Albany and my parent went house shopping and found the best deal one city over in Jeffersonville, which was only 20 minutes away from our place in New Albany. I lived here until I was 19 years old.</P>
      <li>San Antonio<span>  "This city is on my list because it is where I went to basic training."</span></li>
      <p>I lived here for 2 months in USAF Basic training.</p>
      <li>Wichita Falls<span>  "This city is on my list because it is where I went to tech school and learned about my job in the Air Force."</span></li>
      <p>This was the location of my tech school for the USAF, and I lived here for about 5 months.</p>
      <li>Box Elder<span>  "This city is on my list because it is where I have had my two children, my son and daughter."</span></li>
      <p>This is my first duty location, and where I have been living for 4 years.</p>
    </ul>
    <h1>Cities I would like to visit</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Tokyo</strong></li>
      <p>I would like to visit Tokyo for the food and culture, but mostly the food. I am a huge foodie and love Japenese dishes.</p>
      <li><em>Berlin</em></li>
      <p>I would like to visit Berlin for the history and food. I love all things history, and Berlin/Germany in general is a huge hub for major historical events.</p>
      <li><strong>Rome</strong></li>
      <p>I would like to visit Rome from the historical factor. I love the classical and renaissance eras of history and seeing the thousands of year old architecture would be awesome.</p>
